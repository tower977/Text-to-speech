# Text-to-speech

I've recently found my eyes feeling quite strained while working on an application.

I needed to get through documentation so I decided to build a file reader to ease my eyes and incorporate phonetic learning.

I've included sys.arg option in the script to allow me to feed any file type I wish, and to start from a certain page i.e. after indexes and acknowledgments etc.

The formatting from the terminal is as follows;

python3 | file in question | starting page num


python3 some.pdf 18
